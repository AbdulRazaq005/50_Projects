***** FONT ***** :

-----	font-family :

	In CSS there are five generic font families : https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_font.asp

	1. Serif : 		fonts have a small stroke at the edges of each letter. They create a sense of formality and elegance.
	2. Sans-serif : 	fonts have clean lines (no small strokes attached). They create a modern and minimalistic look.
	3. Monospace :	fonts - here all the letters have the same fixed width. They create a mechanical look. 
	4. Cursive :	fonts imitate human handwriting.
	5. Fantasy :	fonts are decorative/playful fonts.




***** POSITIONING ***** :

 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19968979/what-are-the-default-top-left-botton-or-right-values-when-positionabsolute-is

-----	Position : Absolute , Relative , Static , Fixed  &  Sticky

	By Default all html elements are positioned 'static' (normal position in the document flow)
	left, right, top, bottom, margin are '0' when all are auto.(not sure)

-->	Static :	Default position is according to the document flow of all elements.

--> 	Relative : 	Default position is same as in the document flow(static), but it has four properties : left, right, top & bottom.
		Positioned relative to its static position using left, right, top & bottom (all set to '0' by default)
		Other elements do position themselves pretending that this element exist.

-->	Absolute : Default position is same as in the document flow except that, other elements pretend that it is deleted.
		Its position properties (left, right, top & bottom) are all set to auto by default.
		Positioned relative to the 'parent which has position property set to "other than static" '
		
-->	Fixed : 	Default position is same as in the document flow except that, other elements pretend that it is deleted.
		Its position properties are all set to auto by default.
		Positioned relative to the "View Port (Display)"

-->	Sticky : 	Default position is same as in the document flow(static).
		Its position properties (left, right, top & bottom) are all set to auto by default.
		Positioned relative to the "View Port (Display)"

	For positioned elements (non Static) :-
-----	z-index :	Used to positon Divs below or above other elements.
-----	(left,right,top,bottom)='0' and margin : auto => makes element position at the center of parent.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

	Note : For positioning "height" and "width" should be assigned.

-----	display: flex;
  	flex-direction: column;	//	Items stacked as Rows
  	align-items: center;		//	Horizontally center items
  	justify-content: center;	//	Vertically center items 
	height: 1000px;
	width: 1000px;

-----	display: flex;
  	flex-direction: row;		//	Items stacked as Rows
  	align-items: center;		//	Verticallyally center items
  	justify-content: center;	//	Horizontally center items 
	height: 1000px;
	width: 1000px;

-----	Float : Now a days float is being replaced by Flexbox




***** LENGTHS ***** :	

-----	Note : There are two types of length units:	 Absolute & Relative.

Relative Lengths are based on : -
	1.	Parents dimentions (%)
	2.	Currently declared font-attribures (em, rem, ex, ch)
	3.	View Port dimentions (vh, vw, vmin, vmax)
________________________________________________________
%	Relative to the parent element			|
vw	Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport*	|
vh	Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport*	|
vmin	Relative to 1% of viewport's* smaller dimension	|
vmax	Relative to 1% of viewport's* larger dimension	|
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
em	Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font)	
rem	Relative to font-size of the root element	
ch	Relative to the width of the "0" (zero)	
ex	Relative to the x-height of the current font (rarely used)

Absolute Lengths are not based on anything 
________________________________________________________
px	pixels (1px = 1/96th of 1in)			|
	This Laptop has dimentions : 1366px * 768px	|
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
cm	centimeters
mm	millimeters
in	inches (1in = 96px = 2.54cm)




***** OTHER ***** :

-----	overflow : hidden, scroll, auto, or visible	//	https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_overflow.asp 

-----	pseudo classes, @media( ){    }, :nth-of-type( )

TRANSITION :

	transition-property		: The property that gets over ridden like [felx, width, transform, etc] (use 'all' for all)
	transition-duration		: Specifies how many seconds a transition effect takes to complete
	transition-timing-function	: Specifies the speed curve of the transition effect (see below)
	transition-delay		: specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect

-----	transition : [property]  [duration]  [timing-function]  [delay]  ;

	transition-timing-function :-
	ease -	 	specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
	linear - 		specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end
	ease-in - 		specifies a transition effect with a slow start
	ease-out - 		specifies a transition effect with a slow end
	ease-in-out - 	specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end


TRANSFORM :

	scale( ): 	Scales the size of the element. [ values in whole/decimals (2, 0.5) ]
		This also applies to the font-size, padding, height, and width of an element, too. 
			scaleX( ), scaleY( )	
	skew( ): 	Tilts an element like turning a rectangle into a parallelogram. [ values in degrees (-25deg, 25deg) ] 
			skewX( ), skewY( ) 	
	translate( ): Moves an element sideways or up and down. [ values in pixels (20px, -10px) ]
			translateX( ), translateY( )
	rotate( ): 	Rotates the element clockwise from its current position. [ values in degrees (-25deg) ]

	With a space-separated list you can add multiple values to the transform property:
-----  	transform: scale(20) skew(-20deg);

	transform-origin: 	x-axis y-axis ;	// From where the transform starts 
			( left / center / right / length / % )  ( top / center / bottom / length / % )

CURSOR :
	
-----	cursor : property;     	for different types of mouse pointers.

	properties :
		pointer		: Hand symbol
		not-allowed	: No Parking symbol
		wait 		: Loading animation
		none		: Dissappears
		move		: 4 arrows
		grab, grabbing	: Holding hand symbol
